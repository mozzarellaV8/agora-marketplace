# Agora Marketplace Analysis - Domain Research

## Elevator Summary

I'm not an analyst or programmer; I'm actually a photographer with elite art schools on my resume. Kinda odd, I know. The parallels between Photography and Data Analysis are pretty interesting - but there's another time for that. 

So after coming across the work of independent researcher [Gwern](http://gwern.net), I became interested in his exhaustive crawls of anonymous marketplaces - the Silk Roads, those places people buy drugs online, those places [DEA agents steal bitcoin from](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/08/stealing-bitcoins-with-badges-how-silk-roads-dirty-cops-got-caught/). I've done a lot of drugs, and have made and lost my closest friends in that process. I realize it's a complex issue and to hope bring awareness of that complexity beyond sensational shit and black/white, right/wrong mentalities.

The darknet is dark - so shed some light. Most of the major markets have a lifespan of 2 years, more or less - how large could these markets grow if left to their devices? What's being bought and sold, and does this have anything to do with what's prevailing in the dominant culture at the moment? Can the workings of anonymous marketplaces reveal more layers of complexity to the issue of drugs, privacy, and mental health, that move beyond tabloid interest?


#### Amounts People Spend

How much are people spending on clearnet markets (specifically Amazon), and how might this inform or relate to an average darknet market consumer's spending?
