# Agora - Relevant Tags - 'cat' directory

What follows below is some manual parsing of the html files from the Agora Marketplace harvest using a combination of Chrome developer tools and selectorgadget. This was done in preparation for using `rvest` to import the information into dataframes. 

The html pages are from the directory `cat` within the daily listing directories from the harvest. The `cat` folder for each crawl contains pages sorted by category.

- [p directory tags](ag-RelevantTags-p.md)
- [vendor directory tags](g-RelevantTags-vendor.md)
- [initial directory notes](agDirectoryNotes.md)
