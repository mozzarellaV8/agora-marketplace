# {Agora Operational Lifetime} âˆˆ {Bitcoin Price History}

To put exchange rate trends in context - Agora lives in a subset of Bitcoin's lifetime. Bitcoin list prices will change (fact-check) as the Bitcoin-USD exchange rate changes. Does this have an effect on vendor or client behaviour on anonymous marketplaces? Would a client forego their order in the midst of a strong rally?

The Bitcoin price index from its birth through August 2016.

_full disclosure: I'm not an economist_

The union of Agora's operational lifetime and it's place in Bitcoin's history provides a uniquely volatile overlap.
