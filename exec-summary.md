# Executive Summary - Idea in Brief

_please excuse any mistakes_

## The Issue

Anonymous Marketplaces exist as the result of many factors, perhaps none of which can be definitely pointed to as singular cause. Oppressive laws, attacks on freedom-of-speech, the Wars on Drugs, intellectual property in the digital era, privacy preservation, and distrust of prevailing financial models can all be feasible reasons why one might participate in darknet markets.

Rather than treating Darknet Markets as problems that need to be solved - perhaps the nature of their existing beyond the law can be an opportunity to re-assess attitudes at a national and global scale. Given the rapidly evolving pace of technology and it's increasingly seamless integration with everyday life, Darknet Markets stand to provide unique insight into values and beliefs currently held in consensus. 

## Starting Points

One of issues with darknet markets is that they're in the dark. Answering some basic questions might shed some light.

- **How large are these markets?** and, if left unchecked, 
- **How large could they be?**
- **What are the chances the market could double in size, and how long would that take?**

While lying in the exploratory realm, many basic questions would still provide light:

- **Where** is activity originating from? 
- **How much** is for sale, and **for how much**?
- How much **_could_** things cost, or be valued at?

## A Solution

For exploratory purposes, **Association Rule Mining** can provide insight. This technique is often used to discover novel combinations of products and is a vital compononent of collaborative filter and recommendation systems. In this case association rules would be used to begin to visualize the network components of the data - with the mindset that e-commerce mainstays such as Amazon or eBay make extensive use of networked elements. 

To investigate questions of scale and make predictions, **Poisson Regression** and **ARIMA** models will be fit to count and time-series data, respectively. Poisson regression looks to answer the question of scale. ARIMA satisfies a business-minded approach with price forecasting - to examine the most commonly listed items, and treat them as fictional commodities to see where they measure against those that are legally traded. 

For example, a Cannabis index can be created, and measured against the price of Gold per ounce, barrel of crude oil, or gallon of milk. The question can then be asked: 

**_Which is the most sound investment?_**

For better or worse - if something can be expressed in business-terms, it seems that a bridge can be built to widespread acceptance; even legitimacy. Of course, this is conditional on the terms of business being **_profitable_**. A negotiation of the tension between capitlist potential and societal policy...
