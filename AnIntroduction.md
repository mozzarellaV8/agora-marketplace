"...so you can predict quantitative prediction models of human behaviour--"

"--well, wait a minute - what about free will?"

"I'll tell you a little bit about that along the way, because it turns out a lot of our behaviour is habitual, and that's the part we can model mathematically...So the big picture here

and you listen prsident of this and the ceo of that, and when they talk about changing policy - talk about doing anything - they use economics metaphors. and thing with economic metaphors, is theyre all about the individual. so you've heard about rational individuals? and everybody rags on the rational part. I'm not going to do that. i'm going to rag on the individual part, OK? Because I don't think we are individuals. What we desire, the ways we learn to go about doing it, what's valuable - are consensual things. So they actually are capture by this sort of model, this independent model. That matters because those interactions are the sources, not only of fads and economic bubbles, but they're really the social fabric that we live in."

They are led by an invisible hand to...advance the interest of the society and afford means to the multiplication of the species.

Markets are supposed to allocate things efficiently and fairly, right? If you've thought about it, you know this doesn't work in the real world [laughs] ok? And the question is, why? 

...Smith went to say i
It's human nature to exchange not only goods, but ideas, assistance, and favors out of sympathy. It is these exchanges that guide men to create solutions for the good of the community. 


Smith did not believe markets were socially efficient; he believed it was the social fabric of relationships that caused the pressures of the market to be allocated where they're needed.

Adam Smith said way back when, if we could model the peer to peer relationships, we could understand how market things eventually resolve to be much more efficient.
