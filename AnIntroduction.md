# an Introduction

"So you've heard about rational individuals? And everybody rags on the rational part. I'm not going to do that. I'm going to rag on the individual part, OK? Because I don't think we are individuals. 

What we desire, the ways we learn to go about doing it, what's valuable - are consensual things. So they actually are captured by this sort of [quantitative] model, this independent model. That matters because those interactions are the sources - not only of fads and economic bubbles - but they're really the social fabric that we live in."
